/// This struct holds two primary buffers:
/// - **Vertices**: a list of points in 3D space, often including attributes like position,
///   normals, and texture coordinates.
/// - **Indices**: a list of integers that define how vertices are connected to form primitives

///
/// The separation of this data into a standalone `Geometry` struct allows for:
/// - Easy reuse of mesh data across multiple objects.
/// - Efficient memory and GPU data management.
/// - Support for procedural geometry generation (e.g., dynamic terrain, meshes built at runtime).
///
/// # Why Separate Geometry?
/// Keeping geometry separate from transform (`Object3D`) or scene nodes supports:
/// - **Decoupling:** Geometry doesn't carry world position or transform â€” that's handled by the node.
/// - **Efficiency:** Geometry can be shared between instances (e.g., multiple trees using the same mesh).
/// - **Flexibility:** Enables swapping or regenerating mesh data without affecting the rest of the scene graph.
///
/// # Fields
/// - `vertices`: A list of `Vertex` structs that define the attributes per vertex (e.g., position, normals, UVs).
/// - `indices`: A list of `Index` values that define the mesh's connectivity (which vertices make up each triangle).
///
/// # Example Usage
/// ```rust
/// let geometry = Geometry {
///     vertices: vec![/* ... */],
///     indices: vec![0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 0], // A simple quad made of two triangles
/// };
///
/// let mut object = Object3D::new();
/// object.borrow_mut().geometry = Some(geometry);
/// ```
///
/// # Performance Considerations
/// - Vertex/index buffers should be uploaded to GPU memory (e.g., via OpenGL VBO/IBO) during initialization.
/// - Regenerative geometry (e.g. dynamic terrain) should update buffers only when marked dirty.
/// - Use 16-bit indices (`u16`) when possible for lower memory footprint; switch to `u32` for large meshes.
///
/// # See Also
/// - [`Vertex`](struct.Vertex.html) â€“ the structure defining per-vertex data.
/// - [`Object3D`](struct.Object3D.html) â€“ where `Geometry` is attached for rendering.
